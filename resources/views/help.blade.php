                            <p><em>Once the ITRO agent received your ticket, it will undergo the following processes:
                                </em><br>
                                1. Check the details of your ticket. <br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the ticket you sent is not under the scope of ITRO
                                services, the ITRO
                                agent can reject
                                your ticket.<br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if your ticket details is valid, it will be followed
                                by
                                process #2<br><br>
                                2. Updating Ticket Details. <br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ITRO agent who opened the ticket will investigate the
                                incident reported.<br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                After the investigation, the ITRO Staff can now modify the ticket details based on the
                                result of investigation.<br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                They can manually set the impact and urgency, or leave it as the default (urgency and
                                priority is on "Normal")
                                and then assign the ticket to themselves or assign it to other ITRO staff.<br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                The due of the ticket will also be dependent on the priority and will be declared after
                                the
                                modification of ticket details.<br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                The ticket status will then be updated as "OPENED".<br><br>
                                3. Changing of status after opening the ticket<br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                Your ticket will undergo many changes in status as the process of resolution
                                progresses.<br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                But do not worry! The ITRO Staff will keep you updated of the status of your ticket via
                                website
                                notification and email notification.<br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                You can also track the changing of status on the right
                                panel of your ticket screen.<br><br>
                                4. After resolving the ticket<br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                Once your ticket is resolved, the ITRO will edit the resolution details and provide you
                                the
                                step-by-step process of resolving your problem.<br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                You will also be notified if your ticket has been resolved along with a confirmation
                                message.<br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                You can reply via the email notification if your problem is already resolved and
                                the ticket can now be closed by the ITRO Staff- provided that you have the resolution
                                steps
                                already.<br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                After receiving your confirmation, the ITRO will then updadte the status of your ticket
                                as
                                "CLOSED".<br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                If, and only if, after 48 hours, you did not reply to the confirmation message, the ITRO
                                will deem your ticket as resolved and will automatically close the ticket.<br><br>
                                5. After the ticket is closed.<br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                Once you confirm that the ticket can be closed or is automatically closed by staff given
                                that you did not respond on their confirmation message after 24 hours, you have the
                                privilege to Reopen your ticket.<br><br>
